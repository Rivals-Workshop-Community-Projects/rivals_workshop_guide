# Using References

**NO,** there is nothing wrong with using references. Seeing how things look is an absolutely necessary part of making
any kind of realistic art.

\
Brains aren't naturally good at knowing how things look. You may be able to recognize if something looks right, but
being able to generate something that looks natural from your imagination is extremely difficult.

Attempts to work from imagination (without huge amounts of prior experience) are usually overly simple and artificial
looking, because brains don't know how to generate the details.

Drawing from references lets you see those details, make better art, and get a better understanding of how things look.

Most artists should use references almost constantly.

#### Example

If skeptical, try drawing a pixel-art dog buddy in Rivals style, entirely from imagination.

Then draw the same kind of dog while looking at the reference below, and paying attention to how it is different from
your first try.

## Specific references

There's a misconception that a reference must be exactly what you're drawing it, and you need to copy it, like
referencing a picture of sonic to draw sonic.

Usually a reference shows you some small aspect of the subject. For example:

- Spyro the dragon's color palette
- Broken glass for hit fx
- Smash's mario fair pose
- A military officer for clothes design
- A video of rollerblading for run animation
- Absa's got-hit sprite pose

## Pose and Animation references

There are a lot of ways an animation can look unnatural. Follow similar movement in other animations, or similar poses.

- How does someone throw something big and heavy?
- How does someone wind up just before they do a sweeping kick?
- How do four-legged animals turn around?

<summary>Example of how an attack animation can be guided by references</summary>

Say you have a quadruped wildcat character who's going to pounce and swipe with both claws.

Google imaging that movement doesn't turn up much, but there are good examples of lions running and jumping.

That can help with the pounce movement, but finding references for the clawing looks harder. Searching eventually finds
Ms. Fortune sprites in similar poses.

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/skullgirls/images/2/24/Jumping_LP.png" alt="ms fortune jumping lp">

They're not from the same attack (and one is actually a yawn), but they both fit and look catty.

These sources can be combined to make some evocative keyframes for the animation.

## Style references

If something isn't looking right, you can compare
with [Rivals sprites](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qVCZ9uKaAMQcDLDYdkrbeBP9HAibHlu?usp=sharing) that have
similar poses or animations.

- How many frames do they use?
- How do they make that material look shiny?
- How do they make the face clear when it's so small?

# Getting references

- Google images, sometimes with 'animation' in the query.
- [Vanilla cast sprites](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qVCZ9uKaAMQcDLDYdkrbeBP9HAibHlu?usp=sharing) for
  anything about Rival's style.
- Workshop sprites that do an especially good job at what you're working on.
- [Spriter's Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) and [Sprite Database](https://spritedatabase.net/) mostly for
  poses.
- Your own existing sprites, for self-consistency. Especially adjacent animations, like looking at crouch to draw dtilt.
