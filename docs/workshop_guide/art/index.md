# Art

This section will try to teach the art theory used to create good Rivals-style pixel art animations.

Skill is not something people are born with. The people who become great at something are the people who enjoy
themselves while they're bad at it, and keep trying.

Learning a skill comes from **practicing** and **adjusting**, over and over again.

- **Practicing** gives you experience, and helps you see what to adjust.

- **Adjusting** is finding what you should do differently in future practice.

Expect to make a lot of big mistakes. Don't worry about that. What matters is you *recognize and understand those
mistakes*, so you can avoid them in the future.

If you're practicing, but don't know how to adjust, growth will be slower. That is what this guide is for.

## You don't need great art to make a good character

Don't wait until you're satisfied with your art abilities before making a character. The more you improve, the more
you'll see other things to improve at. Work with the skill you have, and you'll improve as you go.

::: quote

You will always find something you would have done differently and agonizing over your first char is going to lead to
sadness.

Just get something out there to the best of your ability as fast as you can, then you can move forward while still
feeling like you've done something.

## You don't need to study theory to make great art

You do not need to diligently study heaps of theory to draw something that looks good. The scope of this guide may seem
intimidating, but it is only to make **adjusting** easier, not as an intimidating required-reading.

The only truly necessary step is practice. The best thing you can do is *draw,* regularly.

When you're not happy with part of your art, and you don't know what to do differently, theory may have the answer.
