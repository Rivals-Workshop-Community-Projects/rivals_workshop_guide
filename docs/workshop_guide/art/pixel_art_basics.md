# Pixel Art Overview

[Pixel art isn't just any art made of pixels.](http://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=11299&PID=139318#139318)

In pixel art, changing the color of one pixel makes a big difference. You place pixels with care and control,
to say a lot with a tiny resolution and few colors.

## Readability

Readability is a key aspect in Rivals pixel art. Characters need to communicate.

Rivals characters are small, and the game is fast. The players need to be able to tell what the other character is
doing within a matter of frames, while dodging and counter-attacking.

To communicate well, Rivals sprites need to be simple and exaggerated.

## Technical notes

- Don't save your pixel art as a jgp or other compressed filetype. It'll get mangled.
- [Only resize your pixel art by whole numbers,](https://saint11.org/pixel_art_articles/article1/#saving-your-file:~:text=Why%20you%20should%20never%20resize%20a%20pixel%20art%20partially)
  or it will end up with pixels of different sizes, called **mixels,** which are terrible.
