# Simplification

Because pixel art is so restrictive, it's more important
to [show a few important things clearly,](https://saint11.org/blog/thoughts_on_low_resolution/#2-keep-it-simple-and-meaningful---focus:~:text=Keep%20it%20Simple%20and%20Meaningful%20%2D%20Focus)
than to try to show many details.

## Noise

Every detail grabs some attention. Too many details ends up making the sprite look crowded and confusing, and distract
from the important parts you want to show.

Textures that use many single pixels, or 1-pixel-wide lines, will create a lot of visual noise, as well as being
difficult to animate. This usually includes thin stripes, tiny dots, or individually drawn scales or feathers.

\
Workshop character **Anstein** had individually drawn scales, crowding the body with noise. The project was eventually
scrapped and restarted because the character was too difficult to animate.

**Wrastor** doesn't have many tiny feathers drawn, but communicates feathers through the shape and shading of his arms.

## Clusters

[Clusters are connected areas of the same color.](https://saint11.org/pixel_art_articles/article2/#what-is-a-cluster:~:text=A%20cluster%2C%20also%20called%20color%20cluster,pixels%20of%20the%20exact%20same%20color.)

Each cluster grabs some visual attention, especially if they contrast with neighboring pixels. Using fewer clusters and
keeping clusters larger will keep the sprite clear and readable.

Rivals sprites will have small clusters, especially around hands and faces. What matters is that the clusters are
conveying important information.
