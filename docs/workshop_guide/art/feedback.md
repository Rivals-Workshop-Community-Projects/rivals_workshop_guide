# Art Feedback

Getting feedback on your work can be very helpful, but requires an experienced volunteer's time, making it often more
costly than learning from other resources (like this guide).

Your primary learning method should be comparing your art with good examples, and understand the theory that separates
them.

When you can't figure out what it's you need to change, that's when to try asking for specific feedback.

## How to ask for feedback

Feedback is most useful when it's focused on what you need to hear.

If you think your run animation looks awkward, don't just post your run animation and ask for thoughts. Try to explain
what you don't like. Maybe post a reference that you want it to look more like.
