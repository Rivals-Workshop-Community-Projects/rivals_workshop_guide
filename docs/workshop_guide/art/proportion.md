# Proportion

Getting characters proportioned correctly is a simple but important step to make them fit in visually.

## Character Size

Rivals characters typically stand **25-45px tall**, and **35-60px wide**.

Average height characters are close to **35 px tall.**

It's not illegal to be outside that range, but small characters tend to feel frustrating to hit, and large characters
tend to get comboed too easily.

Note that Rivals expects sprites to be double sized in the `/sprites` folder. If your character looks like a little
pixel-dwarf, this may be the reason.

## Proportion

A character's height is usually approximately 1/3 head, 1/3 body, 1/3 legs. The vanilla cast make good references for
this.

Most importantly, make sure your character's body proportions are consistent, and don't appear to change while they
move. Exaggerated poses are an exception.

\
Characters should be clearly facing forward, but they usually turn ~45 degrees towards the camera, to make their
features easier to see.
