# Conditionals

Conditionals let you run code only in some situations, letting you create much more interesting behavior.

## If

The most common conditional is an `if` statement.

```gml
// Prints "Going up" only if vertical speed is upwards
if vsp < 0 {
    print("Going up")
}
```

Or more generally:

```gml
if <a boolean, something true or false> {
    <code that should only run if it's true>
}
```

(See [boolean](data_types.md#booleans-true-or-false-values))

`if` statements let you run code only if some condition is true.

```gml
if state == PS_WALK { // While walking
    walk_speed += 0.4// Keep increasing walk speed
} else { // While *not* walking
    walk_speed = 0 // Reset walk speed to very low
}
```

You'll often want to use boolean's logical connectors `and` and `or` to handle more complex conditions, such
as `if window == 3 and window_timer == 1`

Immediately after the `if` block, you can put an optional `else` block, which will run any time the `if` condition is
false.

You can check a series of conditions with `else if` like

```gml
if charge <= 0 {
    print('no charge')
} else if charge < 100 {
    print('charging')
} else {
    print('maximum charge!')
}
```

## Switch Case

Sometimes you might find you have a long `if`-`else` chain checking the value of something, like checking `attack`
in [attack_update.gml](../reference/scripts/event_scripts.md#attack-update-gml). In these
cases you may use the `switch`-`case` statement to streamline the code, though it's entirely optional.

```gml
switch(<a variable>) {
	case <a value>:
        <code to run if the variable equals this value>
        break;
    case <another value>:
        <code to run if the variable equals this value>
        break;
    // More cases
}
```

For example:

```gml
// hit_player.gml
switch(my_hitboxID.attack) {
	case AT_JAB:
        fx_id = jab_fx;
        break;
    case AT_FAIR:
        fx_id = fair_fx;
        break;
    case AT_UAIR:
        fx_id = uair_fx
        break;
    // More cases
}
// Use fx_id
```

`break` is a special statement that ends the current block of code, here ending the `switch` statement.

If your switch case has less than 3 items in it, it'd be clearer to use `if`.
