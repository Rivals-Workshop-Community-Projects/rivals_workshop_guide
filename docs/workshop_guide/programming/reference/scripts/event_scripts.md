# Event Scripts

## Every frame

## User Events

`user_event[0 â€“ 15].gml`

You can call these scripts manually with the `user_event()` function, making them similar to
[`define` functions](../../learning_path/functions.md#making-functions-with-define) that are accessible from multiple
files.

[The Assistant lets you use any define across multiple files.](/assistant/function_library)
