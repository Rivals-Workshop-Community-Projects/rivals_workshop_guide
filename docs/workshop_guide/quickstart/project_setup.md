# Project Setup

**TLDR:
Unzip [this](https://github.com/Rivals-Workshop-Community-Projects/rivals-character-template/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
into `C:\Users\{Your_Account}\AppData\Local\RivalsofAether\workshop\my_new_project`. That's your new project.**

\
Whenever you start creating a new mod, you'll need to make a new project for it.

Your project directory is `C:\Users\{Your_Account}\AppData\Local\RivalsofAether\workshop\`. Create the `workshop`
directory if it doesn't exist.

Each project is a folder in the project directory. Make a new directory named after your project,
like `C:\Users\{Your_Account}\AppData\Local\RivalsofAether\workshop\my_new_project`.

## Templates

Rather than starting from nothing, copy a template into the folder to build from.

- **Recommended**
  [The Assistant Beginner Template](https://github.com/Rivals-Workshop-Community-Projects/rivals-character-template/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
  is designed to make things as easy as possible for new modders, and take advantage of [The Assistant's](/assistant)
  features. This template uses Zetterburn's stats and normal attacks, and Sandbert's animations and specials.

Just unzip the template into a new folder in your project directory.

### Alternative Templates: Using other Rivals mods

For alternative templates, you can start working from any Rivals mod you have downloaded.

Rivals mods you have downloaded appear in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\383980`.

There, you can see the files for any mod you have downloaded. By copying a mod folder to your project folder, you can
edit it.

- [Sandbert](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1865940669) is often used as a new character
  template.  \
  Sandbert is overpowered in many ways, making it a poor foundation. Many parts of the character will need to be
  re-tuned.

::: note

Technically any mod can be used as a starting template, but unfortunately not everyone is open to their work being
reused. Get permission before copypasting large sections of another mod.

(Rather than copypasting, studying and understanding mods is a fantastic way to learn.)
