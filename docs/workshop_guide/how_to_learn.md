## Resources

- General art and animation questions are most easily answered via google.

- For technical problems related to Workshop setup and programming,
  try [The Manual](https://www.rivalsofaether.com/workshop/)
- More general GML documentation can be
  found [at the official site](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/index.html)
- If you're working with some GML that's missing from the official documentation, it can probably be
  found [at the NTT page](https://yal.cc/r/17/ntt/gml/), though it also contains features not available in Rivals.

## Humans

You can also ask people, but they are volunteering their time. Try to use to avoid asking anything you could have
learned elsewhere.

Human help is most appropriate if you have a very specific problem, or you are looking for feedback on your work.

The [Rivals](https://discord.gg/roa) and [ExW](https://discord.gg/GsDqfQyD) discords have channels to discuss and ask
for help.
