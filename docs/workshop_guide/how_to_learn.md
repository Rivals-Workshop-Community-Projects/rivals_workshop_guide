# How to Learn

This guides aims to be a primary resource, so if something is missing contact me
at [qazzquimby@yahoo.com](mailto:qazzquimby@yahoo.com)

## Resources

- General art and animation questions are most easily answered via google.

- For technical problems related to Workshop setup and programming,
  try [The Manual](https://www.rivalsofaether.com/workshop/)
- Find more general GML documentation at
 [at the official site](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/index.html)
- If you're working with some GML that's missing from the official documentation, it can probably be
  found [at the NTT page](https://yal.cc/r/17/ntt/gml/), though it also contains features not available in Rivals.

## Humans

You can also ask people, but they are *volunteering* their time. **Try to use to avoid asking anything you could have
learned elsewhere.**

Human help is most appropriate if you have a specific problem, or you are looking for feedback on your work.

The [Rivals](https://discord.gg/roa) and [ExW](https://discord.gg/GsDqfQyD) discords have channels to discuss and ask
for help.

For art specifically, see [Art Feedback](/workshop_guide/art/feedback.md)
