# Movement

Getting attributes tuned right is more important than it might seem, and has a huge influence on how the character
feels.

::: construction 

This is all rough notes.

:::

## Air acceleration

- Improves recovery by halting and reversing direction faster.
- Aids combat by letting you adjust position quickly during aerials, to extend combos, poke and retreat, or dodge and
  punish.

## Pratfall accel

Relevant both when directly entering pratfall (such as at the end of a movement special), and when parried during an
aerial. Pratfall accel can't be made too high (higher than 0.6-7?)  or it will negate parries.

## Air speed

- Very helpful for horizontal recovery Characters with higher fall speeds or lower jumps naturally travel less
- Allows cha horizontal distance before landing. Increasing air speed can compensate.

## Air Friction

Air friction does not decrease your air speed. It determines how quickly you slow down when you're not holding any
horizontally on the control stick.

- High acceleration + high friction means a character will change velocity quickly in all situations.
- High acceleration + low friction means a character will respond quickly to the player's controls, but be very slow to
  decelerate if the player lets go.
- Low acceleration + high friction means a character will respond slowly to the player's controls, but be very quick to
  decelerate if the player lets go. This would lead to an unintuitive situation where a player trying to slow down by
  holding the opposite direction will take longer than simply allowing friction to take over.
- Low acceleration + low friction means a character will change velocity slowly in all situations.

Low air friction means a character will not slow down as much if the player attempts to use a neutral aerial when
moving, and will cause them to travel a bit further during combos.

High air friction helps resist being KO'd to a degree, and it may be beneficial in some cases to slow to a stop quicker
without providing directional input.

## Gravity

Gravity is a constant downward acceleration.

A character might have high gravity but low fall speed. They would still fall slowly, but reach that fall speed faster.

Hitstun gravity has a significant effect on how easy the character is to combo *todo how exactly*

## Initial dash

Dash dancing stuff

## Run

Chasing, keep away

## Air dodge length and jump squat timing

Important for wavedashing feeling consistent. Changing will make wave dash inputs different than every other character.
