# Rivals Workshop Guide

Welcome to the Rivals Workshop Guide. This is an attempt to collect and curate the community's wisdom to make the
modding journey less overwhelming.

If this guide does its job, it should take you from any skill level to as far as your time and work ethic will bring
you, help you find whatever information you need, and stop you from falling into common traps along the way.

- [Quickstart](quickstart) gets you set up and doing stuff.
- [Programming Guide](programming/learning_path) teaches programming and language features.
- [Art Guide](art) covers the theory behind making good Rivals art and animations.

\
Much more is planned, including:
- [Programming Reference Documents](programming/reference)  \
  Will make all Rivals, Gml, or [Assistant](/assistant)  functions, variables, scripts, error messages, etc, searchable.
- [The Journey](process) will walk modders through the process of building a character at a high level.

When this guide isn't answering your question, try [How to Learn](how_to_learn.md).
