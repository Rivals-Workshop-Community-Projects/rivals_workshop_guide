# Rivals Workshop Community Library

This is the code repository for the website currently found [here](https://rivals-workshop-guide.herokuapp.com/),
collecting and curating the wisdom of the Rivals of Aether modding community.

The focus on the site is the workshop guide, which is intended to bring a new modder from complete beginner to
whatever skill level they're willing to work for, explaining or linking to all required lessons along the way.
