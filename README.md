# Rivals Workshop Community Library

This is the code repository for the website currently found [here](https://rivals-workshop-guide.herokuapp.com/),
collecting and curating the wisdom of the Rivals of Aether modding community.

Right now the focus on the site is the workshop guide, which is intended to bring a new modder from complete beginner to
whatever skill level they're willing to work for, explaining or linking to all required lessons along the way.

Later the site may also hold documentation for Rival's modding api, dialect of gml, and community made tools.
